Hackathon Coach: Your AI-Powered Co-Pilot for Instant Project Scaffolding

  
  
  


Executive Summary
Hackathon Coach is a sophisticated, multi-agent AI system designed to eliminate the friction of starting a new software project. It acts as an intelligent co-pilot, guiding developers from a vague project idea to a fully scaffolded, secure, and deployment-ready GitHub repository in minutes. Built on the Mastra TypeScript framework, it leverages a team of eight specialized AI agents, each an expert in a specific domain of the development lifecycle, orchestrated by an interactive, stateful workflow.
The system stands out with its modular architecture (Agents -> Tools -> Services), a dual-LLM fallback mechanism (Google Gemini as primary, with Ollama as backup), and stateful memory for both short-term conversational context and long-term project persistence via a local JSON database. This makes Hackathon Coach a production-grade AI assistant, empowering developers to build faster and more efficiently.

üéØ The Problem It Solves
Starting a new software project often involves repetitive, time-consuming tasks: brainstorming ideas, creating a project plan, setting up a GitHub repository, writing boilerplate code, and configuring CI/CD pipelines. These steps can take hours, draining creative momentum. Hackathon Coach automates this entire pipeline, enabling developers to focus on building innovative features.
‚ú® Key Features

üöÄ Full-Cycle Project Generation: Transform a single topic (e.g., "AI recipe app") into a complete, initialized GitHub repository in one command.
üß† Specialized AI Agents: A team of eight expert agents handles ideation, security, deployment, code review, and more.
‚öôÔ∏è Interactive & Stateful Workflow: An intelligent workflow pauses for user input, creating a dynamic, guided experience.
üíæ Long-Term Project Memory: The ProjectTrackerAgent saves project details to a local JSON database for persistent tracking and management.
üõ°Ô∏è Dual-LLM Fallback System: Uses Google Gemini as the primary LLM, with automatic fallback to a self-hosted Ollama instance for high availability.
üîß Professional Architecture: Built on a scalable Agents -> Tools -> Services pattern for easy maintenance and extension.

üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Overview
Hackathon Coach is built with professional software engineering principles, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and maintainability.
Technology Stack

Core Framework: Mastra, an open-source TypeScript framework for AI applications.
Language: TypeScript, ensuring type safety and robust code structure.
Primary LLM: Google Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash-latest), used for reasoning, instruction-following, and code generation.
Fallback LLM: Ollama-hosted Qwen (qwen2.5:7b), ensuring high availability if Gemini fails (e.g., due to rate limits or outages).
GitHub Integration: Octokit/rest for repository creation, file pushes, and PR analysis.
Stateful Memory:
Conversational: Managed by Mastra‚Äôs Memory class, with each agent maintaining isolated context.
Persistent: Implemented via projectDBService, using a local projects.json file as a database.

The Agents -> Tools -> Services Pattern

Agents: The "brain," defining personas and high-level goals (e.g., ProjectCoachAgent for ideation).
Tools: The "hands," exposing capabilities like creating repositories or scanning dependencies.
Services: The "engine room," handling complex logic like GitHub API calls and database operations.

Agent Roster

ProjectCoachAgent: Brainstorms ideas, creates development plans, and scaffolds GitHub repositories.
GuardianAgent: Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities and outdated packages.
DeploymentGuruAgent: Adds deployment files (e.g., Dockerfile, .nosana-ci.yml, vercel.json).
ReviewAgent: Conducts qualitative code reviews on GitHub Pull Requests.
CiAgent: Monitors GitHub Actions status for commits.
GitHub Project Insights Agent (GitStatAgent): Generates repository statistics and lists "good first issues."
HelpAgent: Provides resources for coding problems and errors.
ProjectTrackerAgent: Saves and lists project details in a local projects.json database.

Main Workflow: hackathonCoachWorkflow
The workflow orchestrates agents in four steps:

Ideate & Initialize: ProjectCoachAgent refines the user‚Äôs topic and creates a GitHub repository with initial files (README.md, package.json).
Interactive Choice: Pauses to prompt the user to choose between security scanning or deployment setup.
Intelligent Dispatch: Executes the chosen task using GuardianAgent or DeploymentGuruAgent.
Persist to Memory: ProjectTrackerAgent saves project details to the database.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to run Hackathon Coach locally.
